                <p>
                    A fullstack software developer based out of Victor, NY. I am passionate about designing and implementing solutions to everyday problems by combining powerful hardware with intuitive software. I believe in iteration of design processes until all deliverables have been fulfilled, by seeing the product through all phases of design, development, and deployment.

                <p>
                    We follow industry leading UX and UI design concepts. Gordon Labs UI follows similar patterns to Material Design as well as Human Interface to build apps and experiences that are simple, powerful, and compelling. We also arenâ€™t afraid to think outside the box and develop interfaces that challenge and redirect the status flow. We design in ProCreate, Illustrator, Photoshop, and Figma.

                <h2>Mongo, Express, React, Node.</h2>
                <p>
                    We specialize in implementation and development of experiences with the MERN stack. We rely on React for the frontend, write APIs in Express, deploy databases with Mongo, and serve it all up in NodeJS. We also leverage the ability to deploy via React Native and PWAs to expand our reach. All you need is a web-browser.

In high school I participated in our school's FIRST Robotics club, this application was built for us to collect 'Scouting' data during competition matches for developing strategies against other teams and identifying teams we worked well with. This installable web-application interfaces with a database in Firebase and another FRC API by the Blue Alliance.
